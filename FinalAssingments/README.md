# Final Assingments

## Assignment 1 - AA Meeting Data

This assignment reads data from the Alcoholics Anonymous NYC website. This project takes meeting times and locations and displays the information more intuitively for users.
Parsing through the data from the website, we used AWS Postgresql database to host the information. 


## Assignment 2 - Process Blog

This assignment, I created an AWS Dynamo database and entered information from my process blog. My process blog is a database of restaurants that I have eaten at.
Similarly, this project show the location of where these places are and displays comments and ratings of the restaurants.


## Assingment 3 - Sensor Data

This assignment reads information from a temperature sensor. I "placed" my sensor in my kitchen to study how often the kitchen is used.
