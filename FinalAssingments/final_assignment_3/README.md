# Sensor Data

## Prompt

This project si to read in data from a sensor. The sensor used detects temperature in a room at least once every five minutes. This is an effective way of monitoring the room's temperature, which has implications of whether or not someone is in the room.
My temperature sensor is located in my kitchen. The kitchen is a hub in my family and where everyone connects. We have dinner together almost every night and on the weekends we spend the whole day cooking.

## Sketches

This is a sketch to see the month's temperature data. You can click on a certain day to see what the temperature looks like for that day. I think on the weekends, the kitchen is much warmer because more people are home and we are spending more time in the kitchen.

## Mockup

This is closer to what the actual site would look like. This would allow the user to click on a day of the week and see what the temperature was in the kitchen for that day.

## Future

Sinnce we never actually got the sensors, I would really like to one day set one up and connect it to a database. It would be interesting to see how active my kitchen is on what days.
I think this project additoinally could use a "Current Temp" feature and the ability to stack certain days up against each other to offer a comparison aspect.
